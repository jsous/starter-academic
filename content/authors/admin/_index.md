Since July 2024, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Physics and the Energy Sciences Institute at Yale University. From July 2023 to June 2024, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). Before that I was a Gordon & Betty Moore Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University, before which I was a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University. I obtained a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2019.

My research focus lies in the fields of condensed matter, materials physics and artificial intelligence (AI).  One way to view these seemingly disparate areas is through the lens of study of systems with large number of degrees of freedom in which correlations act to stabilize novel behavior, with functionalities which can be utilized in future-generation technologies, such as energy materials.  The goal of this research is to gain a general, unifying understanding of interacting statistical systems.  I progress in this effort by studying model systems that capture experiment in some instances, or by identifying universal features common amongst many experiments in others. I am particularly interested in correlated quantum matter (quantum materials and ultracold matter) and dynamical non-linear systems (optically driven quantum systems and models of neural learning).  My approach to researching these systems relies on a carefully tailored combination of numerical and analytical techniques.

When not working, I enjoy running, sometimes biking and absorbing culture.

_Announcements_: I am actively looking for students and postdocs. Yale is very interdisciplinary, so students and postdocs are often able to work with faculty in other departments.
- Students: If you are already enrolled in a program here and interested in physics or AI or both (with a background in physics, math, applied math, CS or a related field), please reach out to me. If you are interested in joining Yale and working with me, please let me know and apply to the Ph.D. program in Applied Physics (or reach out to me to identify other departments with good fit).
- Postdocs: Please write to me if you are interested. There are also postdoc fellowships available through Yale and externally that may allow you to work with me. One example is the 2024 Tony Massini Postdoctoral Fellowship for interdsciplinary work in the field of data science (previous awardees include researchers who work in the natural sciences such as chemistry as well as statisticians, so all those who are interested in working on physics and/or AI should reach out to me). The deadline of September 20 is fast approaching, so please reach out to me as soon as possible.
