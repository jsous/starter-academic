Since July 2024, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Physics and the Energy Sciences Institute at Yale University. From July 2023 to June 2024, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). Before that I was a Gordon & Betty Moore Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University, before which I was a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University. I obtained a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2019.

My research focuses on the study of systems with large number of degrees of freedom in which correlations act to stabilize novel behavior with functionalities that can be utilizied in future-generation technologies, including but not limited to energy materials. I am in this research to gain a general, unifying understanding of interactions in these statistical many-particle systems. I progress in this effort by studying model systems that capture experiment in some instances, or by identifying universal features common amongst many experimental realizations in others. I am particularly interested in correlated quantum matter (quantum materials and ultracold atoms and molecules) and dynamics of non-linearly driven systems (optically driven quantum systems and models of neural learning). My research relies on a carefully tailored combination of numerical and analytical techniques.

When not working, I contemplate how science can positively affect society. Otherwise, I enjoy running, sometimes biking and absorbing culture.

I enjoy working with undergraduate and graduate students. Yale undergrads and grads: If you are interested in physics, AI or both, like to develop abstract concepts and build code to test ideas, and, most importantly, want to solve important problems,  reach out to me.
