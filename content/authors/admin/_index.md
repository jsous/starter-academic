John Sous is a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Postdoctoral Fellow in the Center for Precision Assembly of Superstratic and Superatomic Solids at Columbia University, where he collaborates with Andrew J. Millis and David R. Reichman.

John's research aims to discover and expose the fingerprints of quantum mechanics in condensed matter formed of electrons in solids and gases, in which correlations conspire to stabilize extreme and sometimes new states of matter, with emphasis on modern platforms designed to reveal hidden physics, such as light-matter interactions in pump-probe experiments and optical cavities, engineered and assembled ultracold atoms and molecules, and quantum materials pushed away from equilibrium. This work relies on a combinations of analytical and numerically exact methods that together provide an understanding of concept underlying the physical behavior. John is always eager to design and build new methodologies that can help push the frontier of research.
