Since July 2023, I am an Assistant Professor at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). Before that I was a Gordon & Betty Moore Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University, before which I was a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia University. I obtained a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2019.

My research focuses on the study of systems in which quantum correlations act to stabilize novel states of matter whose properties can be useful in applied research, such as energy applications.  My research aims to gain a general, unifying understanding of interactions in these many-body systems. I progress in this effort by studying model systems realized in experiment in some instances, or by identifying universal features common amongst many realizations in others. I am particularly interested in correlated quantum materials, ultracold atoms and molecules, and dynamics of non-linearly and optically driven systems. My research relies on a carefully tailored combination of analytical and numerical techniques.

When not working, I contemplate how science can positively affect society. Otherwise, I enjoy running, biking and absorbing culture.

I enjoy working with undergraduate and graduate students. UCSD undergrads and grads: Feel free to reach out to me, I am working on a number of exciting research directions that require analytical and/or computational work, and you are welcome to join.
