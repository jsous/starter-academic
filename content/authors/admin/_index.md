I am a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Postdoctoral Fellow in the Center for Precision Assembly of Superstratic and Superatomic Solids and Departments of Physics and Chemistry at Columbia University, where I collaborate with Andrew J. Millis and David R. Reichman.

My research focuses on the study of systems in which quantum correlations act to stabilize extreme states and sometimes entirely new forms of matter. My research aims to gain a general, unifying understanding of interactions in many-body systems. I progress in this effort by studying model systems realized in experiment in some instances, or by identifying universal features common amongst many realizations in others. I am particularly interested in correlated quantum materials, ultracold atoms and molecules, and dynamics of non-linearly and optically driven systems. My research relies on a carefully tailored combination of analytical and numerical techniques.

When not working, I contemplate how science can positively affect society. Otherwise, I enjoy biking and absorbing culture.
