I am a Gordon & Betty Moore Postdoctoral Fellow in the Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials (GLAM), Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics (SITP) and Department of Physics at Stanford University. Prior to that I was a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Postdoctoral Fellow in the Center for Precision Assembly of Superstratic and Superatomic Solids and Departments of Physics and Chemistry at Columbia University. Starting Fall 2023, I will join the faculty at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as an Assistant Professor. 

My research focuses on the study of systems in which quantum correlations act to stabilize extreme states and sometimes entirely new forms of matter. My research aims to gain a general, unifying understanding of interactions in many-body systems. I progress in this effort by studying model systems realized in experiment in some instances, or by identifying universal features common amongst many realizations in others. I am particularly interested in correlated quantum materials, ultracold atoms and molecules, and dynamics of non-linearly and optically driven systems. My research relies on a carefully tailored combination of analytical and numerical techniques.

When not working, I contemplate how science can positively affect society. Otherwise, I enjoy running, biking and absorbing culture.

I enjoy working with undergraduate and graduate students. Stanford and UCSD undergrads and grads: Feel free to reach out to me, I am working on a number of exciting research directions that require analytical and/or computational work, and you are welcome to join.
