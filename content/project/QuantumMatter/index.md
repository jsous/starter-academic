title: Quantum matter
summary: I actively engage in the study of quantum mechanics of large ensembles of particles in condensed systems, collectively refered to as quantum matter.  This includes quantum materials composed of atomic, molecular or organic constituents, chemical systems such as molecules, and cold atomic or molecular gases. I use first-principle modeling of experiments as a starting point, which often requires _ab initio_ methods to characterize the system's electronic structure. This is combined with many-body approaches to study emergent quantum states. My goal is to discover new emergent quantum behavior in fundamental models of correlated systems and in technologically promising platforms.
