title: Quantum matter
summary: I actively engage in the study of the manifestations of quantum mechanics in ensembles of large number of particles in condensed systems, collectively refered to as quantum matter.  This includes studies of quantum materials composed of atomic, molecular or organic constituents, chemical systems such as molecules, and cold atomic or molecular gases. I use first-principle modeling of experiments as a starting point, which often requires density-functional theory to characterize electronic structure of solids or coupled-cluster methods to characterize electronic structure of molecules. This is combined with many-body approaches to study emergent states, such as field theory, functional determinants or matrix product state methods. My goal is to characterize emergent quantum behavior in fundamental systems and technologically promising platforms.
