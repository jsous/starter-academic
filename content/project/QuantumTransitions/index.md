title: Quantum transitions
summary: I am interested in understanding the manifestations of quantum interactions as transitions in physical observables in experiment. This includes phase transitions, which involve the cooperative behavior of a large collection of particles, or quasiparticle systems such as polarons and bipolarons, in which a transition can happen if two energy levels cross, or, more interestingly, if a state changes character abruptly at the transition point. Besides their importance to foundational theory, these transitions often serve as an attractor to other emergent behavior. For example, superconductivity emergent near a ferroelectric-paraelectric transition represents one class of such problems.
