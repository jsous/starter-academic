## Overview


Meritocracy describes the process of awarding reward to talented individuals in accordance to their merit. Exclusive meritocracy, however, refers to meritocracy in which only exclusive members of a specific group organized according to their interest or pedigree have access to opportunities. Often times individuals with remarkable achievements cannot gain access to such opportunities because they are not members of the exclusivity group. This often emerges within highly attractive fields led by powerful leaders, and impedes outside-the-mainstream talented persons. One should remark that individuals rewarded in exclusive meritocracy tend to be highly successful even if not the most deserving. This explains why exclusive meritocracy propels itself deeper into the fabric of the most successful, impactful academic and industrial institutions.

I believe exclusive meritocracy is driven by an overall trend of imbalance in opportunities in which the number of openings sharply decline from one professional level to the next. For example, the funding for Ph.D. students has exploded in the last few decades, resulting in many more opportunities for undergraduate students to attain doctorates. However, funding for faculty jobs has either remained constant or declined over the same time interval. The overall result is more talented Ph.D. graduates compete for fewer faculty openings. Comparing talent at this very high level presents a challenge. As a result, exclusive meritocracy can often act as the difference maker.

I hope it is clear to the reader why exclusive meritocracy is detrimental to equity. The compounded effect of exclusive meritocracy rampant at various levels of society from childhood to retirement means an overall barrier to diversity and inclusion. This problem requires an overall re-thinking of strategies aimed at enhancing minority representation in the work place. While clearly unfair, some may object that eliminating exclusive meritocracy will negatively impact science and technology; after all, civilization has reached an unprecedented level of scientific development, unmatched in history. Here, I wish to differ and make the argument that exclusive meritocracy hurts science and technology, and as a result hurts the overall good. My main argument is that remarkable scientific and technological achievements often involved ingenious individuals outside the mainstream line of thinking. In a way, the most ingenious approach to a long-standing problem requires a different mindset, a perspective unassumed with the prevailing philosophy within a particular community. (To my mind, one clear example of this phenomena is the theory of the quantum Hall effect developed by Bob Laughlin, who was originally trained in first-principle electronic structure methods.1) This necessitates an openness to outsiders, directly conflicting with exclusivity. Thus, I argue, in the long-term society as a whole and scientific output in particular will be best served by an open culture of merit, open meritocracy.

Some of these thoughts were inspired by an opinion article written published by David Brooks in The New York Times titled "The Meritocracy Is Ripping America Apart", see https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/opinion/markovits-meritocracy.html.

I welcome the reader’s thoughts, contributions to this discussion or objections to my arguments. You can contact me with your thoughts.


1 Perhaps Laughlin faced challenges of exclusive meritocracy and prevailed. I am in no position to judge this. I simply mention this example as a demonstration of success driven by an outsider’s perspective.
