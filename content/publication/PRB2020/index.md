# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Fractons, as a new type of exotic quasiparticle, have attracted immense attention due to their unique properties. Here, the authors construct a connection between fractons and polarons. This allows them to derive explicitly microscopic models, in which polarons and their two-body bound states, known as bipolarons, map exactly on to fractons and their two-body counterparts, dipoles. As a specific example, the authors show how fractons and dipoles arise from magnetic polarons and bipolarons in hole-doped antiferromagnets, thus providing a route towards their physical realization.", Highlight published as Editor's suggestion in Phys. Rev. B.
